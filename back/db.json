The error message states: \n\n**\"Error extracting image text: tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH. See README file for more information.\"**\n\nThis means the system cannot analyze or describe what is in the image because the necessary software (Tesseract OCR) is either not installed or not properly configured on the system. \n\nTo resolve this issue, you would need to:\n1. Install Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software.\n2. Ensure it is correctly added to your system's PATH so the program can access it.\n3. Refer to the README file mentioned for specific installation or setup instructions.\n\nUntil this is fixed, the system cannot provide any details about the content of the image.
